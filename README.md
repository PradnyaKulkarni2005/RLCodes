# Reinforcement Learning for Pick and Place using PyBullet & YOLOv8

This project focuses on implementing a reinforcement learning (RL) agent capable of performing a pick-and-place task using a simulated robotic arm in PyBullet. It integrates real-time object detection using YOLOv8 for perception, alongside structured reward-based training.
